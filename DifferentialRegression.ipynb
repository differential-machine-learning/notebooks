    "This notebook illustrates <b> differential machine learning </b> in the simple context of linear regression. Linear regression is not the most powerful or novel corner of differential ML but it gives us a chance to illustrate and implement the main notions in a very simple context. Differential ML was introduced in our October 2020 Risk article [Differential Machine Learning: the Shape of Things to Come](https://www.risk.net/cutting-edge/banking/7688441/differential-machine-learning-the-shape-of-things-to-come). Its main promise is the design of novel, more effective, ML algorithms based on the availability of <b> differential labels </b>. Classic datasets in machine learning include inputs $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ and labels $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Differential labels are defined as the gradients of labels $Y$ wrt inputs $X$:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        \n",
    "$$Z^{\\left(i\\right)} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial Y^{\\left(i\\right)}}{\\partial X^{\\left(i\\right)}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Differential labels are easily and efficiently computed with [algorithmic adjoint differentiation (AAD)](https://sites.google.com/view/antoinesavine-aad) in some situations, like simulated datasets in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the simplest application of differential ML is a differential variant of linear regression. Recall that linear regression works with a fixed collection of basis functions of $X$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi \\left( X \\right)\\equiv \\left[\\phi_1\\left(X\\right), ..., \\phi_K\\left(X\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "This notebook implements polynomial regression, where the basis functions are all the polynomials of $X=\\left[X_1, ..., X_n \\right]$ with degree up to $p$. The method is extended to arbitrary choices of basis functions in a straightforward manner. Note that the number $K$ of basis functions grows exponentially with dimension $n$, which is also generally true with other choices of basis functions. For this reason, linear regression is ineffective in high dimension and limited in practice to dimension lower than around $10$. More sophisticated ML models like neural networks are necessary in higher dimension, unless dimension is effectively reduced by adequate data pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression approximates the target $Y$ with a linear combination of the basis functions $\\phi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    Y \\approx \\beta \\cdot \\phi\\left(X\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with weights $\\beta$ found by minimization of the mean squared error: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$MSE = E\\left\\{\\left[Y-\\beta \\cdot \\phi\\left(X\\right)\\right]^2\\right\\}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Zeroing the gradient of the MSE wrt weights we find the well-known normal equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\beta = \\left(C_{\\phi\\phi}\\right)^{-1} C_{\\phi y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_{\\phi\\phi} = E\\left[\\phi\\left(X\\right) \\phi\\left(X\\right)^T\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times K}$ and $C_{\\phi y} = E\\left[\\phi\\left(X\\right) y\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ are estimated on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more stable and effective form of regression is obtained by Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes large weights to mitigate overfitting, so as to minimize the modified cost function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\min \\left\\{ MSE + \\alpha \\left\\Vert \\beta \\right \\Vert ^2 \\right\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "leading to the modified normal equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\beta = \\left(C_{\\phi\\phi} + \\alpha I_K\\right)^{-1} C_{\\phi y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Tikhonov regularization (also called ridge regression) is known to effectively regularize linear regression but considerably depend on regularization strength $\\alpha$. Ridge regression reverts to standard regression with small $\\alpha$, hence failing to mitigate overfitting, and converges to a horizontal line with large $\\alpha$, a phenomenon known as underfitting. Because Tikhonov regularization trades variance for bias, a sweet spot must be found, generally by cross-validation. Therefore, ridge regression is not a simple, zero-cost drop-in replacement for linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the availability of differential labels $Z$, <b> differential regression </b> minimizes a combination of value and derivatives errors:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\min \\left\\{ MSE + \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j   E\\left\\{\\left[Z_j-\\beta \\cdot \\delta \\phi_j\\left(X\\right)\\right]^2\\right\\} \\right\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta \\phi_j\\left(X\\right) = \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\phi_1\\left(X\\right)}{\\partial X_j}, ...,  \\frac{\\partial \\phi_K\\left(X\\right)}{\\partial X_j}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ is the vector of partial derivatives of the basis functions wrt the j-th input $X_j$, and $Z_j$ is the j-th differential label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zeroing the gradient of the differential objective wrt weights $\\beta$, we obtain the differential normal equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\beta = \\left( C_{\\phi\\phi} + \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j C_{jj}^\\phi \\right)^{-1} \\left( C_{\\phi y} + \\sum_{j=1}^n \\alpha_j C_{j}^{\\phi z} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_{jj}^\\phi = E\\left[\\delta \\phi_j\\left(X\\right) \\delta \\phi_j\\left(X\\right)^T\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times K}$ and $C_{j}^{\\phi z} = E\\left[\\delta \\phi_j\\left(X\\right) z_j \\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to ridge regression, the hyperparameters $\\alpha_j$ control the relative importance of derivatives correctness in the minimization objective. Contrarily to ridge regression, however, differential regularization does not introduce bias. It follows that it has little risk of underfitting. A reasonable default is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\alpha_j = \\frac{E\\left[Y^2\\right]}{E\\left[Z_j^2\\right]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and doesn't generally require manual tinkering or cross-validation. It follows that, in addition to being much more effective as we will see, differential regression is a simple drop-in replacement for classic regression. Its effectiveness hinges on differential labels, which may or may not be cheaply available in a given situation. In the context of computed or simulated datasets, differential labels are always efficiently computed with AAD. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differential regression, however, doesn't provide a silver bullet against the curse of dimensionality. Like classic or ridge regression, it is limited to low dimension. For high-dimensional problems, unless dimension is reducible by adequate pre-processing, the differential neural networks presented in our 2020 article offer a robust alternative."

    "Classic regression overfits, as illustrated by the wigly shape of its predictions, which also vary significantly in response to the noise in the dataset, a phenomenon known as variance. Cross-validated Tikhonov regularization clearly stabilizes regression, in return for a bias whereby the model struggles to match the correct shape. The results of differential regression, by contrast, appear to be consistently correct (given the small dataset) with much lower variance."

    "The Black & Scholes dataset is one-dimensional, contrarily to most real-world problems in finance, where the market state that affects the price and risk of Derivatives transactions and trading books is typically high-dimensional. To illustrate differential regression in the context of an equally simple but higher dimension example, we consider basket options in the correlated Gaussian Bachelier model. The simulation of the dataset is essentially a carbon-copy of the Black & Scholes simulator. This example is also interesting because the price and risks of a basket option only depend on the initial price of the underlying basket under the Gaussian assumption, irrespective of single stocks. This is therefore a single-dimensional problem, but of course, the fitting algorithm is unaware of this fact and treats the dataset as multi-dimensional. We can, however, conveniently visualize results with two-dimensional graphs where the horizontal axis is indexed by the initial basket.\n",

    "Differential regression shines in higher dimension 3 to 7. Above dimension 7 to 10, however, all forms of linear regression become very slow, and rapidly fill computer memory. Linear regression is not effective in high dimension, and differential regularization does not provide a silver bullet. It gives a sharp improvement over classic regression and well-known forms of regularization. But its applicability remains limited to dimension under about 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications in finance, where dimension routinely stands in the hundreds, linear regression, differential or otherwise, is only possible when coupled with effective dimension reduction. Dimension reduction is not only strictly necessary for linear regression, it also facilitates, stabilizes and speeds-up more sophisticated ML models like neural networks. It is a recommended pre-processing step in all circumstances.\n",

    "Classic dimension reduction algorithms like principal components analysis (PCA) are however unsafe, prone to truncate subspaces of little variation, which may still affect prices and risk in a substantial manner. By contrast, <b> differential PCA </b>, developed as a part of the differential ML ecosystem, provides a safe and effective dimension reduction, once again, leveraging differential labels. In the basket example, differential PCA univoquely identifies the underlying basket as the only relevant regression feature, safely reducing dimension to one. Differential PCA is covered in the Risk article <b> Axes that matter: PCA with a difference. </b>"

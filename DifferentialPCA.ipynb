    "Differential PCA is an application of <b> differential machine learning </b> to dimension reduction. Differential ML was introduced in our October 2020 Risk article [Differential Machine Learning: the Shape of Things to Come](https://www.risk.net/cutting-edge/banking/7688441/differential-machine-learning-the-shape-of-things-to-come). Its main promise is the design of novel, more effective, ML algorithms based on the availability of <b> differential labels </b>. Classic datasets in machine learning include inputs $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ and labels $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Differential labels are defined as the gradients of labels $Y$ wrt inputs $X$:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        \n",
    "$$Z^{\\left(i\\right)} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial Y^{\\left(i\\right)}}{\\partial X^{\\left(i\\right)}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Differential labels are easily and efficiently computed with [algorithmic adjoint differentiation (AAD)](https://sites.google.com/view/antoinesavine-aad) in some situations, like simulated datasets in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential PCA leverages differential labels to perform dimension reduction in a safer and more effective manner than classic PCA or other classic dimension reduction algorithms. Classic PCA projects data on axes of orthogonal variation and truncates coordinates on axes of insignificant variation. We demonstrate in the article that classic PCA is unsafe and ineffective in financial applications, because variation is not the correct metric. Small variations in the input space may have large repercutions on a given Derivatives transaction or trading book, so PCA may unwillingly truncate critical information from the data. Conversely, directions of large variation may be irrelevant for the target, preventing PCA to reduce dimension as much as would be otherwise possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, differential PCA projects data on axes of principal <b> relevance</b>, defined as the magnitude of directional derivative sensitivities, and revealed by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the differential data $Z$. We demonstrate in the paper that differential PCA is safe, in the sense that it guarantees that no information meaningful for the target may be lost in dimension reduction. It is also effective, in the sense that further (linear) dimension reduction cannot be performed without deletion of meaningful information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differential PCA is discussed in detail in the article. This notebook provides an implementation, along with basic application examples. The follow-up notebook [Bermudan5F.ipynb](https://github.com/differential-machine-learning/notebooks/blob/master/Bermudan5F.ipynb) applies differential PCA to the practical problem of Bermudan swaptions, illustrating the shortcomings of classic PCA in a context of practical relevance where we also illustrate the properties and benefits of the differential counterpart, and demonstrate its application to identify Derivatives risks from simulated data."

If <i> n_components </i> is a positive integer, the data is projected on the <i> n_components </i> principal axes of relevance, truncating coordinates on the remaining <i> n_features - n_components </i> axes, where <i> n_features </i> is the original dimension of the data. If <i> n_components </i> is a real number between 0 and 1, dimension reduction is set to explain at least the proportion <i> n_components </i> of the total relevance, in other terms, the (squared) error of projected gradients (denoted $\\epsilon$ in the article) is smaller than  <i> 1 - n_components </i>.\n",
    "The parameter <i> central </i> may be set to perform central differential PCA, as discussed in the article. Default is non-central DPCA, the correct alternative for most applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <i> fit </i> method performs differential PCA, i.e. eigenvalue decomposition of gradient covariance. It takes input data $X$ and differential data $Z$ for compulsory arguments. For consistency with scikit-learn's PCA, it also takes labels $y$ as an optional argument, which is ignored.\n",
    "Results are available after fitting in the following attributes:\n",
    "- <i> n_samples_ </i> (integer) the number of training examples\n",
    "- <i> n_features_ </i> (integer) the dimension of original data\n",
    "- <i> mean_ </i> (vector of dimension n_features_) the means of the original data columns\n",
    "- <i> n_components_ </i> (integer) the reduced dimension\n",
    "- <i> components_ </i> (matrix of dimension n_components_ x n_features_) the n_components_ axes of relevance, represented by (othogonal) unit vectors and sorted by decreasing relevance\n",
    "- <i> explained_variance_ </i> (vector of dimension n_components_) the relevance (gradient magnitude) of the n_components_ principal axes\n",
    "- <i> explained_variance_ratio_ </i> (vector of dimension n_components_) = explained_variance_ / total_relevance (sum of relevances of the n_features_ axes)\n",

This method can also project derivatives $Z=\\partial V / \\partial X$.

The notebook [Bermudan5F.ipynb](https://github.com/differential-machine-learning/notebooks/blob/master/Bermudan5F.ipynb) further demonstrates it in the context of Bermudan options, highliting further properties and benefits of differential PCA in an example of practical relevance. The notebooks also highlights critical differences between classic and differential PCA, and shows how differential PCA identifies the risk factors of exotic Derivatives."
